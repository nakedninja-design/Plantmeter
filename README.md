Wireless Plant Meter (ESP8266 + ATTiny85)

The Plantmeter is a device that monitors the soil moisture levels of your plants.
It uses authenticated HTTP POST command over Wifi to communicate with a plantmeter hub that gathers all the data and notifies you when a plant needs watering.

Works with any webserver, home automation system  or other device that can process HTTP POST commands.

Works right out of the box in combination with our plantmeter hub.
Has its own webinterface to configure the ID, network settings and sleep time.

The plantmeter is a rechargeable, battery powered, device that can operate for 6 months on 1 charge.
Comes with STL design files for 3d printed enclosure.
